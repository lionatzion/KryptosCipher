# Kryptos K4 — Exported Artifacts

This folder contains two files you can save into your project:

1. **k4_top10_summary.json** — the 10 highest-scoring candidates with their keystream_27, a small Berlin-clock window, and the resulting plaintext strings.
2. **k4_top100_candidates_light.csv** — a lightweight table of the top 100 candidates with only: rank, score, r7, r8, r20, keystream_27.

> Tip: Keep the JSON as your working set for qualitative review, and use the CSV for quick filtering/sorting inside your analysis notebooks or spreadsheets.
